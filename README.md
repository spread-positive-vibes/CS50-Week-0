# CS50-Week-0
Week 0 scratch project
This is my first time using Git-Hub and my first time learning something about programming. I hope I am submitting this Project correctly, I would count myself as one of the "less comfortable". 
I made a maze game, since cat´s are afraid of water I made rain drops fall from the top of the scree. The cat wants to go "home" as quickly as possible, the user is supposed to bring the cat to the other end of the maze. When the rain-drop-sprites touch the cat, the cat is put back to the starting point of the maze. I added a variable, which counts the tries, the user needs to complete the game. When the game ends the backdrop changes, the second backdrop congratulates the user and tells them how to start again. Please wait 5 seconds after you press the green flag, since the cat says something for 5 seconds and only afterwards changes it´s size, before the cat changes it´s size it does not fit into the maze, therefore moving it around while it´s still saying something is a bit akward. The cats were slightly altered by me, they are not the original cat sprite that´s available on scratch, but I didn´t change much I simply removed their bodies and changed their expression.
